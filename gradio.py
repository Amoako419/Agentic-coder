    2. Code examples solving similar problems
    3. Common issues or errors related to this task and their solutions
    
    Perform Google searches using these queries and collect the most relevant information.
    Focus on recent, authoritative sources like official documentation, GitHub repositories, Stack Overflow answers, and reputable coding blogs.
    
    Organize this information clearly, including:
    - Links to key documentation
    - Code snippets that demonstrate solutions

    Review the coding task understanding, research, and solution from the session state.
    
    Create a comprehensive but concise explanation that includes:
    
    1. SOLUTION OVERVIEW:
       - Summarize the approach taken to solve the problem
       - Explain why this approach is appropriate
    
    2. CODE WALKTHROUGH:
       - Break down how the key parts of the code work
       - Highlight important functions, methods, or patterns used
    
    3. LEARNING RESOURCES:
       - Suggest specific documentation or tutorials for further learning
       - Point out related concepts the user might want to explore
    
    4. NEXT STEPS:
       - Suggest how the user might extend or improve the solution
       - Mention potential edge cases or considerations for production use
    
    Make your explanation educational and helpful, assuming the user wants to understand not just what the solution is, but why it works and how they can learn from it.
    
    Format your response using Markdown for better readability, with code blocks for all code examples.
